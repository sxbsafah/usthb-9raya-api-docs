# USTHB Hub API

- Express + TypeScript + MongoDB
- JWT auth with roles (`user`, `admin`)
- File uploads via multipart/form-data (Cloud upload), limits noted per route

Use the sidebar to navigate routers. Each endpoint shows:

- Auth requirement
- Request body (JSON or multipart/form-data)
- Validations
- Success and possible errors
